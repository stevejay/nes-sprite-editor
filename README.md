# nes-sprite-editor

An in-progress creation tool for NES background and sprite data.

## Introduction

This is an in-progress tool to aid with my learning of Nintendo NES games programming, specifically how the graphical assets for a game are specified and manipulated. At the moment it is just a loose collection of widgets, with no data persistence. Nevertheless, it looks pretty sweet :)

## TODO

- Use [typed arrays](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Typed_arrays) for efficiency?
- I had to pin `save-file` package to version 2.0.0 because of an import problem

## Resources

- [Dustmop blog posts](http://www.dustmop.io/blog/tag/graphics/)
- [NES-breakout](https://github.com/89erik/NES-breakout) looks to be nicely structured code
